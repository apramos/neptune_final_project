# Parhyale Opsins - where do they stand?

## Introduction and Goals
Light information is detected by visual pigments composed of a chromophore bound to a transmembrane protein, the opsins. Opsins are able to absorb photons from a given wavelenght and produce action potentials. Different opsins are sensitive to a different wavelenght.
In vertebrates this spectral tunning can be associated with differences in a.a. sequence. However in invertebrates this is not yet the case and therefore most studies use comparative methods to id potencial sites involved in spectral tunning.           

There are 3 main classe of spectral sensitivity in arthropods:
LWS - long wavelenght sensitivity
MWS - middle wavelenght sensitivity
SWS - short wavelenght sensitivity


Pahyale hawaiensis is an amphipod crustacean recently established as model organism for evo-devo and regeneration studies. Parhyale has an apposition compound eye and transcriptome analyis indicates that there are 2 opsins.

I will build a phylogenetic tree using sequence data from already described arthropod opsin sequences and undescribed Parhyale hawaeinsis opsin sequences. Knowing the hypotetical phylogenetic position of Parhyale's opsins might give indications about their absorbance spectrum.



## Methods 
###Pipeline

choose species
get opsin data sequence from NCBI (based on Porter et al 2006)
translate nucl. sequence
build a.a and nucl. alignment using MAFFT
generate a.a. and nucl. tree
